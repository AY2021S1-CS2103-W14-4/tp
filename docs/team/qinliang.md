## Project: CLI-nic

AddressBook - CLI-nic is an application to help medical product sales managers keep track of medical products and storage. It is optimized for these managers to update product conditions and access critical product information quickly via fast typing.	The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
