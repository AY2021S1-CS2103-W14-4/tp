## Project: CLI-nic

CLI-nic is **an application to help medical supply managers keep track of medical products and storage.** It is optimized
for these managers to **update product supply conditions and access critical product information quickly** via fast typing
and efficient Graphical User Interface interaction.
It is written in Java, and has about __ kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **New feature**: Added the ability to delete a supplier/supply/store/order.
  * What it does:
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: {mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (_ releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
