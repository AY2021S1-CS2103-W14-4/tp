## Project: CLI-nic

CLI-nic is **a desktop application to help medical product sales managers keep track of medical products and storage**.
It is optimized for these managers to **update product conditions and access critical product information quickly via fast typing**.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find relevant suppliers or warehouses by name, remark and/or products
  sold/stored.
  * What it does: Allows the user to find relevant suppliers or warehouses in addition to their related information.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily search for information
    that they need without having to look through every entry.
  * Highlights: This feature originally did not take in prefixes for its parameters. To achieve consistency with the
    rest of the commands which were taking in prefixes, this feature had to be re-implemented.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=zhengweii&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)
