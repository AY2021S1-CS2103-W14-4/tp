## Project: CLI-nic

CLI-nic is a desktop application used to help medical product sales managers keep track of medical products and storage.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is optimized for these managers to update product conditions and access critical product information quickly via fast typing.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
