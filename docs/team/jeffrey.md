## Project: CLI-nic

CLI-nic is **a desktop application to help medical product sales managers keep track of medical products and storage**.
It is optimized for these managers to **update product conditions and access critical product information quickly via fast typing**.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Major Enhancement**: Enhancement to add command (Pull requests: [#112](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/112), [#113](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/113))
  * What it does: Allows the user to insert new Supplier/Warehouse into the CLI-nic Supplier/Warehouse List
   respectively.<br>
   The user can add:
    * A Supplier that contains the following attributes: Name of Supplier, Phone, Email and Remark
     (Optional)
    * A Warehouse that contains the following attributes: Name of Warehouse, Phone, Address and Remark
     (Optional)
  * Justification: This is an important feature and it is a must-have. It is the first touch for most users
   and allows the user to effectively keep track of medical products and storage.

* **Major Enhancement**: Refactoring of AddressBook-Level3 to accommodate application use case (Pull request: [#100](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/100))
   * What it does: Acts as the initial codebase for team to allow for the easier building of features into the application.
   * Justification: This is an essential update, which minimises the refactoring that each member has to do
    which could require more time to resolve and synchronise.
   * Credits: The refactoring is done on the codebase provided by [AddressBook-Level3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3)
    
* **Minor Enhancement**: Fix bugs for the Application (Pull requests: [#130](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/130), [#131](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/131), [#141](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/141), [#158](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/158), [#160](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/160), [#165](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/165), [#172](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/212), [#212](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/pull/212))
   * What it does: Restricts user from performing invalid actions and improve user experience when using
    application.
   * Justification: This is an essential update, as invalid actions would affect the functionality of the
    application. Unresolved UI bugs may not display all the information that users are looking for.
